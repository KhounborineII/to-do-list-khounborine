# To Do List Application

A Personalized Flutter Demo Project

## Available for All!

This app was built off the skeleton of a broken To Do List App by [Mark Goadrich](https://github.com/mgoadric/to-dont-list).

As simple To Do List Application, the user can add new todos, cross off completed todos, and delete those completed todos. This is also a student project required for my CSCI 352 - Mobile Software Development class at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/). Thus, I was also required to not only fix this app, but to add my own features to it! 

### The Basic Look

In the above screenshot, you can see the most basic features of the app: 
- The To Do List
- Crossing Out Completed Todos

Pretty simple right? Let us look at how a Todo is added:

Here is an example of what adding a new Todo looks like, kind of cool right?
Now, how about the deletion feature? I cannot exactly show it in an image, but I can show you what it looks like post-deletion.
