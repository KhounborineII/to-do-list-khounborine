# To Do List Application

A Personalized Flutter Demo Project

## Available for All!

This app was built off the skeleton of a broken To Do List App by [Mark Goadrich](https://github.com/mgoadric/to-dont-list).

As simple To Do List Application, the user can add new todos, cross off completed todos, and delete those completed todos. This is also a student project required for my CSCI 352 - Mobile Software Development class at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/). Thus, I was also required to not only fix this app, but to add my own features to it! 

### As of November 7th 2022, this app has been updated further including a new feature! (That was or was not an actual requirement of the original assignment I did not originally do) (Why are these Images still so big? I don't know!) (Pull Request it maybe lol?)

### The Basic Look ![/assets/images/appshot1.PNG](/assets/images/appshot1.PNG)

In the above screenshot, you can see the most basic feature of the app: 
- The To Do List

Let us see what we can do from here:

### The New Widget

Would you look at that! A new widget that extends the functionality of the FloatingActionButton. From here we have two options, Add an Arcana Todo or Add a Personal Todo to our Todo List. Let's try adding our own first:

### The Pop-Up and More

Great! Working as intended. Of course, the features of crossing out a Todo and deleting a Todo still exists. My previous addition of being able to edit an already created Todo is still here too! 

### Going through the Basics

Besides the new Speed Dial Widget, this is where I originally ended, but wait! There's more! Its time to see what that Arcana Todo was:

### Draw!

Would you look at that. Based on the Astrologian Cards of the **INSERT FFXIV COPY PASTA HERE**, the user will receive a random card from the six unique arcana and be given one of three unique todos based on that arcana. With it, you have two options: either click "Give me Another" to Redraw and receive another card, or choose to add this todo to your Todo List!

Let us Redraw to see another possible todo:

### Redraw!

There we go! I like this one better. Unfortunately, once you have chosen to receive an Arcana Todo, you must choose one. There is no Undraw (Seriously, who the heck uses Undraw???). Unless you can actually just swipe back to the main page, I was not able to test that. Now, back to the Todo List!

### A Todo List Reborn

Now, I would say that's all, but I would be lying. Unfortunately this is not as clean as it looks. The Arcana Todo will only appear once this page has been rebuilt. Simply click a few buttons here and there should do the trick. I wish I could have solved that, but it looks like the job for a **Pull Request! OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!**
