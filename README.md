# To Do List Application

A Personalized Flutter Demo Project

## Available for All!

This app was built off the skeleton of a broken To Do List App by [Mark Goadrich](https://github.com/mgoadric/to-dont-list).

As simple To Do List Application, the user can add new todos, cross off completed todos, and delete those completed todos. This is also a student project required for my CSCI 352 - Mobile Software Development class at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu/). Thus, I was also required to not only fix this app, but to add my own features to it! 

### The Basic Look

In the above screenshot, you can see the most basic features of the app: 
- The To Do List
- Crossing Out Completed Todos

Pretty simple right? Let us look at how a Todo is added:

### The Pop-Up

Here is an example of what adding a new Todo looks like, kind of cool right?
Now, how about the deletion feature? I cannot exactly show it in an image, but I can show you what it looks like post-deletion.

### It's Gone!

Wow, those images are kind of big...
Besides that, now you can see that completed Todo is now completely gone.
But what makes this app stand out? What's the new feature you added? You asked, and I shall give it to you! Take a look at my "Island Sancturay (Savage) todo. Isn't there something wrong with it? That's right! I mispelled Sanctuary, woops. No matter! With the Edit Feature I implemented, fixing that will be as easy as breathing (my apologies to those with asthma). 

### The New Feature!

With this, I can fix my mistakes, I can make this right!

And viola! Hope you enjoyed looking at this slightly improved version of Goadrich's broken To Do List App made by yours truly.
